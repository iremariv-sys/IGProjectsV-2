# OpenGL projects skeleton for non-Visual Studio environments (namely Linux or macOS)
#
# This is a Meson (https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html) build script
#
# It uses the OpenGL, GLFW, and glm libraries installed in the system
# (for example, in Ubuntu/Debian, they can be installed with
# "sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglm-dev").
#
# Execute "meson configure -Db_sanitize=address" in the build directory to enable
# memory leak detection.
